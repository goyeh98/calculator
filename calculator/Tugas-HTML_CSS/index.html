            <h1>A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities.</h1>
            <br />
            <p>
              The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500 companies has allowed me to developer a skillset that helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any business.
              <br />
              <br />
              I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young minds about how to <i>sell</i> yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunites.

            <p>
              As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's holding you back is yourself. <br />
              <br />
              A qupte I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean. <br />
              <br />
              "How big would you dream, if you <b>knew</b> you wouldn't fail?" You've already gone through the hardest parts being a developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in something you're <i>passionate</i>about
              <br />

              I'm happu to chat over coffee some time about how i can help your company.
